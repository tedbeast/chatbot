/*
 * key takeaways:
 * we're able to define a new 'custom datatype' called a class (and java makes everything a class, basically)
 * we're able to create new instances of that custom datatype known as objects
 * the class, which functions as a template or blueprint for objects, can have different variables (which we call fields, states)
 *      as well as methods (behaviors), and the behavior of those methods could change depending on the object's own individual fields
 * the process of creating a new object is known as instantiation
 * oop is good :^) but it's tricky to figure out!
